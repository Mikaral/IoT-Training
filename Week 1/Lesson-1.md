- Define the term IoT.
- State the technical trends that have led to IoT
- Describe the impact of IoT on a society

## Lecture 1.1: Definition of IoT

**First, what exactly IS a thing?**

Anything besides a computer (Desktop/Laptop/Server)

**Ok! So what does Internet of Things mean?**

We add a computational intelligence to a Thing to improve the function of the device. Finally, we add internet connectivity to further enhance its function. With all of this together, Voilà! We have a IoT device!

**Pretty easy, right?**

## Lecture 1.2: IoT Devices

**One classic example of a IoT device is a nowadays car. Why?**

Well, nowadays cars has LOTS of computational intelligence. It probably has more than 50 chips in there. For instance, the Anti-Lock braking system has it's own processor just for that system, the same goes for fuel injection and so on!

A important thing to note is that a modern car has the same interface as a 1950 car, we still drive in the same way, but with some systems that makes our life wayyy easier.

**Okay, we have computational intelligence, but where is the internet???**

These modern cars are using way more network, to remote start, to contact 911 by the internet in case of an accident. And we don't even started talking about Tesla cars which we can connect to a GPS network and trace a route, connect to Spotify, Social media, etc.

**Great, now we know why modern cars are IoT devices!**

**Another example is a Logistical tagging (Barcode). Wait, what?**

First, let's understand the functionality of a Logistical Tagging. When moving devices (That's logistic in layman's terms) we have to track these devices, that's where barcodes comes in! Barcodes exist for a while. Nowadays, we usually don't use barcodes, we use RFID tags instead of barcodes.

**But why???? why RFID tags????????**

Good question! RFID tags can store a lot more information, and that information can change (be dynamic). And they can be easily be networked, so you can track globally and in real time your devices.

**Right! Now we know why nowadays logistical tagging devices are an example of IoT!**

## Lecture 1.3: Devices vs Computers

**IoT devices are made for a special-purpose**'

Well, the biggest and most obvious difference to IoT Devices and Computers is that IoT devices have a main function separate from computation. Despite being a common joke on the gaming community, the main function of an toaster is NOT to compute things, the same goes from a fridge, a microwave, etc. But tell me one thing that you can do with your Intel® processor apart from processing things.

Computers are not good with a particular application, but they are generally good with everything. You can definitely record a video using your webcam and record the audio with the integrated microphone of your laptop, but a Camera and a Microphone that are made for that purpose will be better at this job.
