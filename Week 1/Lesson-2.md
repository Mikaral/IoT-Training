## Lecture 2.1 - Trends in the adoption of IoT

- Cost: The cost of hardware has decreased a lot in comparison of 1970-ish. You could not add a computer to a 1960 car because it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but now you could add some computers without adding too much at the cost.
- Size: Another problem was the size of the computers, back in the day a computer would fill a entire floor. There was no way you could add this to a car, for example. Nowadays, much more powerful hardware has few centimeters.
- Significant computation and speed: for common resources used on IoT as Speech-to-text, audio processing and network communication you would need a significant computational speed that you do not had on the 50's.
- Internet access had improved DRASTICALLY, on most countries a large majority of people have internet access, and this also contributed to the adoption of IoT.
- Wireless Access: Running cables is expensive, and putting up a router is way less expensive.
- Data costs are fairly low: Most people can afford it, though this is arguable.
- Bandwidth is high: The bandwidth is becoming higher and higher and this make possible to many data heavy IoT applications to work.

**Ok! Now we know what are some trends that helped the adoption of IoT!**

## Lecture 2.2 - IoT is powerful and Pervasive

### IoT is powerful

A lot of what you can think of IoT devices, you could see them as an interface to the cloud. For example, take Siri, you could her as a interface to a massive cloud database. If you see a movie on Netflix for example, the movie isn't on your device, it's transmitted via internet by a giant data center. Many IoT devices are used to leverage Data centers.

### IoT is Pervasive

Nowadays, IoT is everywhere and even though you may don't use it all the time, it is everywhere and is generally helpful. If you think about it, you will realize a lot of IoT devices around you, watches, home appliances, etc. For example, at my work we got motion sensors to detect your presence and RFID readers to detect entry/exit.

You maybe even have a IoT device on you! No, I'm not talking about that 5G conspiracy bullshit, I'm talking about Insulin pumps and Pacemakers, all of these are IoT devices!

If you think about it, in many countries IoT is literally in most of streets, by CCTVs, Traffic Lights, etc. 

**Great! Now we know why IoT is powerful and pervasive!**
