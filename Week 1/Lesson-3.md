## Lecture 3.1: Societal benefits of IoT

### IoT makes life easier!

The use of Internet of Things technology makes life easier, that's the goal. In lots of different ways depending on the device, but it's supposed to make life easier. Back to the example of the smart fridge, this fridge take care of some details that you don't want to be bothered about, like restocking food for you, automatically ordering a new water filter, that sort of thing. So, the IoT implementation on this fridge it's supposed to make your life easier. Basically, you enhance the features of some devices to make them do things that are very helpful to you. But, you don't want to enhance the features in such a way that it increases. So the complexity is dealt with by the computational infrastructure inside the device. 

### Independence for people

IoT devices handle things that usually you would need a human to do. For example, fewer doctor visits, I don't need to go to the doctor to verify my blood level on my sugar, or my oxygen saturation, I can use IoT devices to do that for him. Of course, you need to visit doctors if something is wrong, but these devices are really handful to check if something is wrong with you.

You see, depending on people for some things can be burdensome, specially for infirm people. And IoT devices help to be more independent on this matter.

### It connects you to the World!

 I can very briefly state that. Imagine this quarantine without internet, the absolute chaos that would be. Yep, you can partially thank to IoT devices, like your phone, for not losing touch with your family and friends if they live far from you.

**Awesome! Now we know some societal benefits of IoT devices!**

## Lecture 3.2: Risks, Privacy and Security

### Isolation

One advantage that we listed in the last lecture was that you don't have to depend on people as much. You can depend on your IoT device to do things for you, and you don't have to deal with people as much. So the downside of that is potential social isolation, right? You don't have to leave your house if you don't want to. You can be a hermit Stay in your house, never walk out, and have everything come to you. Right? Now, usually it doesn't go to that extreme, but it can happen. It depends on the mindset of the person who's using the device. But if you need to interact with people less, you have less of an excuse to go out there and deal with people. Say you're at a party and people at the party, which is meant for human interaction, reading their cellphones and looking down at their devices rather than actually interacting. So, you can have this increased risk of social isolation because you don't have to interact with people. 

### Dependency on Technology

So, if things go down, like for instance my email. And this is not even really an Internet of Things issue. But, email, I use it on a standard computer or my phone too, if I want to. But if email goes down, it's a serious impediment to me. I need my email on a daily basis, really, an hourly basis. I need to get emails from people. And so, when that type of thing goes down, it's a problem for work and for some people, their personal life, right?


For instance, if it's a life critical thing, like we talked about insulin pumps a couple of lectures back. If that thing has a bug, that's a serious problem. I mean, you can die off of that, right? A pacemaker has a bug, there's a serious problem. And these things actually happened in medical devices too, that you've had these bugs and people have died. We won't go into them, I don't have slides on these right now. But there are devices that this has happened. And the more these IoT devices get integrated into our lives,the more dependent we are.So when they go wrong, it's a much worse problem for us. 

### Privacy and Security

Another property of these IoT devices is they are, they're recording information. They are observing us. Now, presumably for our benefit. But they are observing us a lot and they are pervasive, so everywhere. So for instance, your cell phone. That thing is observing your location. If you have your location services on, which most people have on because a lot of applications depend on those services. You have that on, it is reported your GPS, your location at all times, and it can easily be sending that data back to Apple or whoever, whoever your manufacture is. This type of data is being tracked by your phone, and sent back to some central location. Now maybe they're using it for good purposes, to help you. Like having your location means that when you're looking for a restaurant, you don't have to report your location, it just knows, and it can tell you where all the nearby restaurants are. So that can be beneficial. But it is tracking you all the time.

**TV watching habits, media watching, whatever media you're watching** 

That type of thing is. So, say you've got a new TV, it can track, in fact it typically records what you watch. In fact, my DVR it flags, when I'm looking at the list of TV shows, it flags which ones it thinks I'll want to watch. Now, how does it figure that out? It's tracking my activity, knows what type of shows I've watched in the past, finds similar shows and suggest them to me. So that's a benefit, right? But just understand that it is tracking everything that you're watching on your TV or your DVR, things like this. 

**Driving habits** 

So, cars have lots of sensors, about the speed and things like that, and if you're hitting the brake, something like that. And car incident reporting, the insurance agencies can use that when you're trying to get money back for your car. So say you crash your car and you say, look, I was hitting the brake and they say, well, the car says you weren't hitting the break. So, you owe us this much money, right? So that type of data is being recorded, sent to insurance agencies, and they can use that against you. 

**So, data can be used to market to you.**

Often you give permission to the person you purchase the device from, you give them permission to use that data in those long agreements that you click Okay to. So when you buy a device, buy a phone, or put an application on your phone and it says do you accept the agreement terms? And you don't read that, but you click Okay. So, in that, you are giving up all ownership of all data often. Right? So all this data that's being tracked, it can legally be given to some third party agency, and then they can sell that data whenever they want to. So, it's hard to keep track of your data. You don't know who has your data, because you agreed at some point to allow them to own that data.

**We learned some disadvantages of IoT devices.**
